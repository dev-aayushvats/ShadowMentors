This file connects frontend and backend framework. It takes the data from the registration form and stores it in the database(as view.html)

I was very new to backend development and did not  know any popular frameworks. I tried to learn Flask concepts in the hackathon itself and implement it. I tried my best to learn the framework. I completed the code to my fullest potential in the given time constraints.
