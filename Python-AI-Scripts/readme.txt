These files use an api to fetch data from an ai.
##working##
Just run the python code in the terminal:

1.  For xp_calculator.py file
     -> first input is the roll number in the format of the new rollnumber e.g. MC22BT009.
     -> second input is any +ve integer referring to your number of skills.
     -> last input is the file that you want to upload on the website.
-----## the code will basically rate the file using an AI an then after performing some mathematical function it will return the XP of the author of the file.

2. For code_explainer.py file
     -> First input is the file containing code that you want to understand.
-----## This code will return a .txt file containing entire step-wise explaination of the given input code.

3. For random_idea_generator.py file
     -> Once you run this file it will give you a random interesting project idea that you might want to work on.

Basically all these inputs were supposed to be taken from the database itself but due to time crunch we could not finish it properly:(
